				"Dr. Ben Babu is an experienced hospital medicine physician who has taken courses and has done" + " executive work in AI System Design for Healthcare, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. He states that emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence help by improving time costs and repurposing clinical skills in the healthcare environment. A significant amount of manual data entry and repetitive work can be automated, reducing the time spent away from direct patient care, clinical personnel burnout, etc.\n",
				"The usage of AI in the US Healthcare Market is expected to grow approx 31% in the next decade, including software solutions, hardware, and services. Dr. Babu states that there is a large amount of active AI research in the world, the US and China being the most involved. As regards healthcare, Diagnostic Medical Imaging (mainly MRI and CT) benefitted from the largest amount of “mature” research and implementation. By medical specialty, AI research leads in oncology, neurology, and cardiology. There are current clinical trials for the use of AI to detect diabetic retinopathy, for breast cancer screening, and FDA-approved AI-based medical devices.\n",
				"The speaker explains that with the emergence of Big Data, data is generated at a large volume, high velocity, and variety, which is extremely helpful but also gives chance for errors.. AI Project Development is a multiteam approach, and should simultaneously consider the healthcare system’s scope/outcome, the metrics of performance, the business strategy, the kind of intellectual property, data strategy, and the legal/security/risk management. There are also risks for AI implementation, such as limited explainability, adversarial attacks leading to errors, biases in the AI models, unintended outcomes, healthcare regulation changes, etc. AI ethics and safety should be monitored in order to prevent unintended uses, to be reliable, treat people fairly, guard data privacy and security, be inclusive and transparent with how it functions, and who is accountable for the actions of the AI process.\n",
				"Dr. Ben Babu states that because of HIPAA laws, sharing patients’ data is very limited and AI models can help avoid transferring and exposing actual patients’ data, improving privacy. There is still a multitude of challenges in the path of AI’s broad implementation in healthcare, such as regulatory, legal, privacy, security, financial return on investment (outcome), data management, integration into the healthcare systems, etc. However, the involvement of AI in healthcare improved patients’ satisfaction, the workflow in the hospital setting, drug developments, and genomic research, reducing the number of errors and clinical personnel burnout, creating a positive impact."

				"Hypersonic weapons are the most advanced warfare flying vehicles of our times, an emerging technology attracting a high level of interest from many countries due to their impressive strategic capabilities. These weapons travel at hypersonic speeds, can fly very long distances at low altitudes, being almost undetectable by radars, and also capable to maneuver and change trajectory during flight. For this reason, hypersonic weapons are difficult to be tracked and destroyed before hitting the target. The hypersonic weapons can be carriers for mass destruction missiles, including nuclear warheads, making them a frightening offensive tool and a symbol of power. Consequently, they became a subject for competition between the world’s military superpowers and a desired asset for several smaller countries with escalating ambitions.\n",
				"There are two main types of hypersonic weapons: hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles, the first ones being launched from a rocket to reach their hypersonic speed, while a scramjet propels the cruise missiles. A hypersonic glide vehicle carrying a missile is called a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS), and the studies about this system started in the 1970s during the Cold War time, in both adversary countries, the USA and the USSR. China’s rapid economic development in the last decades propelled this country to the rank of a new military power in the world and on top of the development and testing of hypersonic weapons. Some analysts consider that China has left the US behind in regard to the development and testing of this top military technology. According to media news, the USA confirmed that China tested in August 2021 a hypersonic glide vehicle as a nuclear weapon.. During the same period of time both Russia and the USA conducted tests of hypersonic weapons, North Korea also announced the same testing with impressive media coverage, and other Asian countries as India are developing this weapon.\n",
				"Considering the current evolution in the field of hypersonic weapons, it became important for the USA to stay on top of the development and testing of these technologies. Considering the situation in our world, it became extremely important also to develop the defense capabilities against any hypersonic nuclear attack from hostile regimes of other countries. The USA needs to keep a priority for the most advanced military, strategic and defense weapons, in order to be able to ensure the balance of military and economic powers in the world, and maintain the safety of the people against aggression."

				"In this episode of the podcast History of Philosophy, the guest Liam Kofi Bright, assistant professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, discusses W.E.B. DuBois’ Philosophy of Science. DuBois was one of the pioneers of US sociology, but also covered scientific work in criminology, history, and economics. His career goal was to pursue the truth, convinced that science has to play a social role in democracy, and needs to gain people’s trust. He considered that the best way in science is to explore different options, theories, methodologies, and hypotheses because the value of pluralism in scientific work leads to better sciences.\n",
				"DuBois’ book “The Philadelphia Negro”, is a work of urban sociology where he combines quantitative and qualitative methods, trying to offer an accurate image of the social, economic, religious, family life, and crime of African-Americans in Philadelphia. He saw this population as a “nation within a nation” because of the peculiar condition of slavery and how they had to adapt to a new reality after the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, and industrialization. DuBois concluded that the situation of African-Americans was such a moral calamity and urgency that the society has to accept the scientific conclusions and act before the ideal scientific process would determine to have enough evidence to do something. He thought that scientists working on race issues in America should suspend their custom scientific behavior, ignore the “value for ideal” and act on the basis of less evidence than normally required.\n",
				"Liam Bright discussed DuBois’ use of “triangulation”, meaning the simultaneous use of several methods in scientific work, justified by the author in the preface of his book “The Philadelphia Negro”. By aggregating multiple methods and choosing the most acceptable conclusion, DuBois imported some of the methods of democracy, like voting, into his scientific practice. He wrote books like “The Souls of Black Folk”, where he gathered together historical, sociological, political, moral, and esthetic considerations, to get as close as possible to the truth. When he was younger DuBois strongly considered that ignorance is the most important problem for the race discrepancies and racism in America, that white people are just not aware of the conditions black people are facing in society. He thought that he only needs to involve work and time in persuading white people to understand the truth.\n",
				"DuBois considered that the scientist does the most reliable and trustful work when passionately involved in the problem. He worked to prove that he can be trusted as black people’s representative in front of society, by supporting the need for effective strategies for reform. The guest states that over the course of his life, DuBois became less and less convinced that there is anything he can do to persuade the racists into a different attitude but continued to believe in the necessity of more engaging writing."
