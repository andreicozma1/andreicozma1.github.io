        <h1>DNA Topology and Transcription Regulation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Dr. Laura Finzi, Emory University, Physics Department</li>
            <li>Date: Wednesday, March 31 at 4:45pm to 5:35pm</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The speaker talks about the topology of DNA as it relates to its transcription and gene. Topology is the study of the anatomical connectivity of a geometric space. The study of topology is useful for understanding the physical limitations of cells; it provides insight into the relationship between gene expression and anatomy; and it can aid in the successful design of human-made materials. The idea behind further research started with a paper on transcription regulation of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci. The paper shows that the transcription is regulated by the topology of the DNA. The speaker talks about the importance of topology here, and how it can be leveraged to better understand transcription.
        The DNA double helix has two basic topologies: right handed or left handed. Although the DNA double helix was discovered in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick, it wasn't until the 1970s that scientists began to identify distinct right-handed and left-handed structures. Right-handed DNA is more abundant and more stable than its left-handed counterpart. Right-handed DNA forms a right-handed (positive) supercoil, and the direction of the rotation is such that each successive turn of the helix winds on in the same direction as the preceding turn. This positive supercoil is formed when the phosphate backbone is pointing toward the right. The direction of the helix is along the axis that contains the sugars. Since the sugar moieties point to the right, so do the backbone carbons and the attached bases. In contrast, left-handed DNA forms a left-handed (negative) supercoil. Here, the direction of the rotation is such that the successive turns of the helix wind on in the same direction as the preceding turn. This negative supercoil is formed when the phosphate backbone points toward the left.

            <li>Presenter: Tracie Prater of NASA</li>
            <li>Date: Tuesday, March 2nd</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           The speaker discusses a variety of topics and examples regarding the on-demand manufacturing of metal components, electronics, as well as recycling and reuse. "NASA is committed to 'faster, better, cheaper,' which includes the use of rapid fabrication processes to enable new and innovative ways to create products and reduce the time it takes to go from idea to launch. This presentation will describe NASA's ability to provide on-demand manufacturing of metal components and rapid prototyping for metals and plastics. It will also cover how NASA is using rapid-prototyping methods to create reusable and recyclable parts, such as food trays and water bottles, as well as reducing waste." The speaker focuses on the importance of recycling and reusing wherever possible, as well as the implications of new manufacturing technologies that are accelerating social and technological change. Fabrication methods such as 3D printing allow for the creation of highly customized and complex structures, and are essential tools for modern manufacturing processes. Important questions to consider are how is the technology changing our infrastructure and industrial design? How can the technology be used to more effectively create optimal and sustainable products, and how can it be used to maximize societal benefit? The speaker focuses on practical implications of innovative technology and how it is changing the way we design products and the way we manufacture them. No longer are we confined to the limitations of traditional manufacturing methods and creation of products, we can create the product we need for the application and the application for the product with on-demand 3D printing.

        <h1>CHP Overview All Cohorts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Rebekah Page</li>
            <li>Date: Thursday, January 21</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           The mission of Honors & Scholars is to enrich each scholar’s experience by offering unique opportunities that support our core values of intellectual curiosity, critical awareness, social responsibility, and personal integrity. In collaboration with campus, community, and global partners, CHP combines carefully chosen honors coursework and specialized programming with high-impact practices such as living learning communities, study abroad, research, internships, and service to prepare scholars to become lifelong learners and leaders in their respective communities. Being an honors student means more than taking challenging classes and performing well; it means striving for excellence in character and professionalism, in and out of the classroom. Furthermore, it means being a personal and socially responsible leader in the campus community and beyond. The Honors and Scholars Programs offer a wide variety of engagement opportunities to get more involved and engaged on- and off-campus. Academically, all honors students are expected to maintain a cumulative 3.5 Chancellor’s Honors grade point average (GPA) to remain in good standing. In addition to the academic and course requirements, all Honors & Scholars students will be expected to complete co curricular requirements including those specific to their program. Three honors seminar reflections per semester are required to be posted on the personal portfolio webpage. The Honors ePortfolio is updated with seminars once per semester. The e-portfolio is a “living” document: it will change and grow as you accumulate experiences such as conducting research, participating on a study abroad, completing an internship, compiling your thesis, or reflecting on student organizations, athletics, or travel.

        <h1>BlueSky Statistics Workshop</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Office of Information Technology (OIT)</li>
            <li>Presenter: Bob Muenchen</li>
            <li>Date: Friday, November 6 at 10:00am to 12:00pm</li>

        </ul>


        <p>
            Mr. Muenchen is the author of "BlueSky Statistics User's Guide" as well as the "R for SAS and SPSS
            Users".
            In this workshop, he goes over the basics of BlueSky, a free and open source data science package
            with extensive features for data management, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
            His user guides, work, and tutorials are freely avaliable online, which is a great contribution to the
            open-source community.
        </p>
        <p>
            BlueSky effectively unlocks the power of the R programming language for the analyst community with a
            rich user interface that allows for the creation and deployment of statistical modules, applications,
            functions, and much more.
            There are three main audiences of this program are people who need to analyze data, but who lack the
            time or inclination to become programmers.
            The second audience could be people who are proficient in R can also use this program in order to speed
            their development by having BlueSky automatically generate parts of their projects.
            Third, BlueSky is great for teams who seek to either

        </p>
        <p>
            One of the biggest strengths of BlueSky is it's transparency and discoverability.
            While most of the actions can be done through the graphical user interface, there are many ways to tweak
            statistical models for a fully customizable experience.
            The point-and-click user interface is easy to learn and use; however, the power resides with it's use of
            the powerful R language.
            It allows for easy modification of complex models and algorithms directly to the R code which is readily
            available for the user to look at and tinker with.

        <h1>Data Management Best Practices</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Research and Data Curation</li>
            <li>Presenter: Chris Eaker</li>
            <li>Date: N/A (Asynchronous)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The speaker talks about a variety of topics and examples regarding the importance of using
            well-designed data management practices and techniques relating to data entry, manipulation, quality
            control, data storage, as well as backups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Properly using data management practices ensures you are able to stay well organized. Data itself must
            not only be well-organized,
            but also must be well documented, preserved, accessible, accurate, and valid.
            The result of using these practices is high-quality data that is easy to share and re-use in science.
            It allows for the citation and credibility of the research, overall cost-saving to furthering science
            research.
            This not only helps you, the researcher, but also the public by allowing the community to build upon the
            work of others, performing meta-analyses, and sharing resources and perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data entry and data manipulation practices to ensure that data is of good quality.
            Allows for better version control and contributions by different teams or team members collaboratively.
            Well-established data-management practices help track data for improved transparency, repoducibility,
            and comparability of results.
            The goals of data entry are to create data that are valid, to ensure quality, organize to support the
            use of the data, as well as the ease of archiving.
            Database vs Spreadsheets pros and cons. Spreadsheets are great for charts, graphs, and calculations.
            They are flexible about cell content type, such that cells in the same column can contain numbers or
            text.
            They lack record integrity, for example you can sort a column independently of all others.
            They are also really to use, but harder to maintain as compelxity and size of data grows.
            Relational databases are easy to query to select portions of data. Data fields are typed;
            for example, only integers are allowed in integer fields. Columns cannot be sorted independently of
            eachother.
            Lastly, they infovlve a steeper leanring curve than a spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality control and assurance practice to reduce errors.
            First, before data collection, a research should think about defining and enforcing standards that will
            be used during a project.
            Consider formats that will be used for the data tables or data entry forms.
            Also, if abbreviations of codes are used, they should be defined up front.
            Measurement units should be also specified, and relevant metadata should be identified before data
            collection.
            Assign rfesponsibility for quality before collection begins.
            Use techniques that help eliminate errors during data entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Design data storage well. Minimize the number of times individual items must be entered repeatedly.
            Use consistent terminology and atomize data: one cell per piece of information.
            Document changes to data, avoid duplicate error checking to save time and allow undos if necessary.
            Always check for missing, impossible, or anomalous values to identify and minimize potential data
            contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Backups deal with data that is copied elsewhere and potentially be overwritten again as the data
            changed.
            They are in essance a snapshot of the data at a point in time.
            This allows the user to restore the file as needed in case of corruption, loss, etc.
            Backups are usually used for short-term storage but sometimes also for long-term storage, usually
            performed on a regular schedule.
            Archiving makes a record of data that is usually in it's final state, and is performed at the end of a
            project or milestones.
            There are many reasons to perform backups, including limiting or negating the loss of data.
            Save time, money, and productivity. Help prepare for disasters, human error, or computer failures.
            Allows to reproduce results, respond to data requests, and overall limits liability.

        <p>
            This seminar is an interactive discussion and learning opportunity that tackles on a topic called the
            Impostor Syndrome.
            The impostor syndrome is the self-conscious idea that success is highly driven due to luck, rather than
            talend and qualifications.
            The idea was first identified in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes.
            Research on the topic has shown that the effect is experienced by both men and women because of an
            inability to internalize on their own successes.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several patterns that have been found in people who experience feelings related to this.
            For example, perfectionist personality types set extremely high expectations for themselves and for
            their work.
            However, a majority have found that even if they meet 99% of their goals successfully, they still feel
            like failures.
            In this case, small mistakes or imperfections in their work will cause a trigger which makes them
            question their own competence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, certain people feel the need to know all extents of information before starting
            a major project and will constantly look for new trainints in order to improve their skills or
            proficiency in a topic.
            In this case, people may exhibit behavior that internalizes their feelings, such as not applying for a
            job if they feel like they don't meet all the criteria.
            Another example which I feel like is very relatable for lots of students is avoiding or being hesitant
            to ask questions regarding their concerns or speaking up in a work or team environment due to the
            feeling of sounding inexperienced or foolish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third, people who tend to excel in a variety of topics, the "natural genius", may feel like an impostor
            when they have to struggle or work unexpectedly hard to accomplish their goal(s). In this specific case,
            it may exhibit the feeling of not being good enough.
            Certain other behaviors that can be seen are people who feel like they need to accomplish a task on
            their own,
            avoiding to ask for help due to feeling that's a sign of weakness or fraud.
            Another case can be with people that constantly push themselves to work harder than everyone else
            for the sole purpose of proving that they're not impostors. They may experience heavy amounts of stress
            when they feel like they're not accomplishing something.
        </p>
        <p>

            The underlying causes of these feelings were also discussed, and the truth is that there may not be a
            single answer to the question.
            Certain experts believe that it may have to do with specific personality traits, such as anxiety or
            neuroticism. However, others focus on more family-related or behavioral causes.
            Perhaps childhood memories, such as achieving a specific set of goals in school or that grades were
            never good enough for parents may be an underlying cause for certain people, for example.
            There are also a multitude of external factors that can influence such behavior, such as the environment
            people live in. For example, levels of confidence can differ widely
            depending on the environment you're surrounding yourself with, such as being around people who look,
            sound, or behave like you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various steps that can help deal with the impostor syndrome, and their effectiveness
            definitely depends upon many specific factors and circumstances.
            For example, try to separate feelings from fact. Just because you may feel stupid, does not mean you
            really are.
            It's also important to normalize and recognize that self-doubt might be a normal response to being a
            beginner, instead of taking self-doubt as a sign of ineptness.
            When inevitable mistakes happen, accentuate the positive outcomes and forgive yourself when the
            inevitable happens.
            Keep in mind and recognize that you have just as much right as the next person to be wrong, have a day
            off, or simply ask for help.
            Visualize your success, develop a new script in your head, as well as a new response to failure and
            mistake-making.
            Lastly, reward yourself as a way to try to break the repeating cycle of seeking and dismissing
            validation for yourself.
