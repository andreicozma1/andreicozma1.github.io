        <h1>Healthcare AI – Augmenting Clinical Workflow</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Gemma Leigh Roberts</li>
            <li>Date: Tue April 19 2022</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Dr. Ben Babu has been a hospital medicine physician for 15 years. He currently works at the Westchester Medical Health Network in New York. He’s taken several courses and has done executive work in AI System Design for Healthcare, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. His AI interests specifically are automating clinical workflows, computer vision, and ambient intelligent applications. He starts the presentation by stating that emerging technologies such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help healthcare providers in their daily activities by improving time costs and repurposing clinical skills in the healthcare environment. Problems with current healthcare fragmentation, enormous time on data entry tasks, huge administrative burden, time spent away from direct patient care, clinical personnel burnout, etc., can be improved by the use of AI. A significant amount of manual data entry and repetitive work can be automated. Despite the concerns that AI will negatively impact the job market, the speaker presents data supporting that AI seems to keep humans in the workforce.
            The usage of AI in the US Healthcare Market is expected to grow approx 31% from 2020 to 2030, including software solutions, hardware, and services. The number of AI-related research articles increased over the past five years and is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years. Covid-19 was an accelerator for AI, especially in the pharmaceutical industry and genetics studies, in an attempt to come up with solutions for the pandemic. Dr. Babu states that there is a large amount of active AI research in the world, the US and China being the most involved in this research and in collaboration for this purpose. As regards healthcare, Diagnostic Medical Imaging (mainly MRI and CT) benefitted from the largest amount of “mature” research and adoption of AI in daily practice. By medical specialty, AI research leads in oncology, neurology, and cardiology. One of the clinical trials that are currently validated is the use of the Deep Learning Algorithm for automatic scans through AI to detect diabetic retinopathy. AI systems for breast cancer screening are proving faster and more accurate than radiologists in detecting oncologic developments and have alerts for incidental findings aside from the main pathology. Furthermore, a few months ago FDA approved AI-based software for devices to be used in medicine.
            The speaker states that with the emergence of Big Data, associated with the 4th Industrial Revolution, data is generated at a large volume, high velocity, and variety, which is extremely helpful but also gives chance for errors that should be minimized. AI Project Development is a multiteam approach, and should simultaneously consider the healthcare system’s scope/outcome, the metrics of performance, the business strategy, the kind of intellectual property, data strategy, and the legal/security/risk management. Digital transformation requires huge teams, a multidisciplinary approach to find solutions, involving hospital management, a business analyst, a project manager, system engineers, data scientists, clinical professionals, the hospital’s IT, hardware, AI production team, software development team, etc. There are also risks for AI implementation, such as limited explainability, adversarial attacks leading to errors, biases in the AI models, unintended outcomes, healthcare regulation changes, etc. AI ethics and safety should be monitored in order to prevent unintended uses, to be reliable, treat people fairly, guard data privacy and security, be inclusive and transparent with how it functions, and who is accountable for the actions of the AI process. In the USA the regulatory agency for AI is the FDA and there are international guidelines such as ISO IEC Standards.
            Dr. Ben Babu affirms that because of HIPAA laws, sharing patients’ data is very limited and, concerning this fact, using AI models avoids transferring and exposing actual patients’ data, helping to improve privacy. There is still a multitude of challenges in the path of AI’s broad implementation in healthcare, such as regulatory, legal, privacy, security, financial return on investment (outcome), data management, integration into the healthcare systems, etc. However, the involvement of AI in healthcare improved patients’ satisfaction, the workflow in the hospital setting, drug developments, and genomic research, reducing the number of errors and clinical personnel burnout, creating a positive impact.

        <h1>Hypersonic Technology: What it is, Why it Matters, and the State of American Defense Capabilities</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Dr. Ragini Acharya</li>
            <li>Date: Friday, April 22 2022</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With their impressive strategic capabilities, hypersonic weapons are the most advanced warfare flying vehicles of our time. Most importantly, these weapons can maneuver and change trajectory while in flight. Unlike conventional ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons are difficult to track and destroy before hitting their targets. In addition to being a terrifying offensive tool, hypersonic weapons are a powerful symbol of power. As a result, they became a source of competition among the world's military superpowers, as well as a sought-after asset for several smaller countries with growing financial potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main goal in developing hypersonic weapons is to avoid detection by conventional radars and interceptions in flight. They can fly at least five times faster than sound and spend most of their time in the atmosphere, reducing surface radar detection range. Hypersonic weapons are classified as either hypersonic glide vehicles or hypersonic cruise missiles.
           </p>
        <p>
            A fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) is a hypersonic glide vehicle carrying a missile that was studied in the 1970s by both the USA and the USSR. China's rapid economic development in recent decades has made it a new military power in the world, leading the development and testing of hypersonic weapons. Some analysts believe China has surpassed the US in the development and testing of this cutting-edge military technology. The US confirmed that China tested a hypersonic glide vehicle as a nuclear weapon in August 2021, even though the Chinese government denied it was a weapon. North Korea announced the same testing with impressive media coverage, and other Asian countries like India are developing this weapon.

        </p>
        <p>
            Given the current state of hypersonic weapons, it is vital that the USA keep abreast of new developments and tests. Given the current global situation, it is crucial to develop defense capabilities against hypersonic nuclear attacks from other countries. The USA must prioritize the most advanced military, strategic, and defense weapons to maintain the global balance of military and economic power and protect the people from aggression.

        <h1>History of Philosophy – DuBois’ on the Philosophy of Science
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Liam Kofi Bright</li>
            <li>https://historyofphilosophy.net/du-bois-bright</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this episode of History of Philosophy, Liam Kofi Bright, assistant professor at LSE, discusses W.E.B. DuBois' Philosophy of Science. DuBois' ideal of value-free science and its place in his broader thought are specifically mentioned. W.E.B. DuBois was a pioneer in US sociology, but also worked in criminology, history, and economics. DuBois sought the truth even if it meant ignoring his own social science agenda, convinced that science must be social in order to gain public trust. He acknowledged that science is not objective, but that the scientist must decide what evidence is sufficient to support the truth. He believed that exploring different options, theories, methodologies, and hypotheses is the best way to improve science because it encourages diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Philadelphia Negro", a work of urban sociology, combines quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a broad picture of African-American life in Philadelphia, according to the speaker. DuBois used a variety of sociological methods to portray the era's social, economic, religious, family, and criminal conditions. He was particularly interested in the plight of African-Americans in America. Abolition of slavery and industrialization forced this population to adapt to a new reality, which he called a "nation within a nation." Because the situation of African-Americans is morally calamitous, DuBois concluded, the society must accept scientific conclusions and act before the ideal scientific process finds enough evidence to do anything. He believed that scientists working on racial issues in America should disregard the “value for ideal” and act with less evidence than usual.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of “triangulation” in DuBois' scientific work was also debated. Triangulation is the simultaneous use of several methods in scientific work, and DuBois explained why he did it in the preface of his book “The Philadelphia Negro”. Using multiple methods and adopting those conclusions that the majority agrees with increases the chance of veridicality. DuBois incorporated democratic methods into his scientific practice by combining multiple methods and choosing the best conclusion. His methods were distinct in terms of how they accessed and generated data, but not in terms of the underlying scientific theories. The important thing is that the scientist has multiple chances to choose the most accurate answer to the scientific problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guest acknowledges W.E.B.DuBois as a major social scientist and science theorist. Even though he believed that scientific research should not be mixed with political activism in books like “The Souls of Black Folk,” DuBois believed that scientists do their best work when they are personally invested in the issue. Throughout his career, the sociologist changed his views and methods for persuading people with his scientific work. He used to believe that white people are simply unaware of the conditions black people face in society. DuBois believed he could persuade white people to accept the truth with work and time. He tried to be more careful with the criminology data, presenting that many claims about black people's propensity for crime were simply false. DuBois realized he couldn't persuade as many people as he thought he could.
        </p>
        <p>
            The speaker believes “The Souls of Black Folk” represents a period in Dubois' scientific work when he needed to bring more accurate information about black people's condition while also involving more rhetorical work to persuade society to care. DuBois also worked to gain black people's trust by demonstrating his commitment to the cause and his ability to represent them in society. According to the guest speaker, DuBois lost faith in his ability to persuade racists to change their minds but remained convinced that better writing was required.

        <h1>Cultivating a Growth Mindset</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Gemma Leigh Roberts</li>
            <li>Date: Friday, December 3 2021</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In this LinkedIn Learning Workshop, Gemma Roberts demonstrates how to cultivate a growth mindset, distinguish between a fixed and growth mindset, and challenge yourself in your daily life to achieve your goals. People who have a growth mindset believe that their talent and abilities can improve. This mindset is the polar opposite of a fixed mindset, in which people believe that talent and ability are inborn and unchangeable. The growth mindset is a helpful way of thinking about your own life and achieving your objectives. Failure is viewed as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. You'll be more likely to take on challenges, try new things, and work hard to achieve your goals if you have a growth mindset. You must remind yourself that you can change and grow, even though it will take some time. You can commit to developing a growth mindset and then take small steps forward, considering what you are good at, what you are not good at, and what you can improve on. If you can then concentrate on these things and try to improve them, you will discover that you have more potential to grow. The more you push yourself, the more you'll realize your full potential, and the more you allow yourself to improve, the more you'll believe you can. This will not happen overnight, and it is unavoidable that you will experience failure or a setback at some point. It's possible that you won't succeed at something you're trying to do or believe you're good at. For one, acknowledge that everyone fails at some point and just give it another shot. It is important to view failure as another step towards a better self and achieving success and future improvement. Overall, if you want to develop a growth mindset and become more successful, you must keep trying, work hard, and push yourself to do better, even if your first attempts fails.

        <h1>Probability and Stochastic Processes Seminar</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Dr. Federico Sau (IST Austria)</li>
            <li>Date: Tuesday, November 16 2021</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            David Aldous introduced the Averaging process as a Markovian mass redistribution model on a graph in a series of lectures and articles published around 2011-2012. The Averaging process is roughly described such that for each vertex is initially assigned a real-valued mass, and at exponential times pairs of neighboring vertices split their mass equally among them. The purpose of this session is to give some recent results on the mixing of a generalization of the Averaging process. Specifically, the process occurs on an increasing sequence of graphs that are supposed to be "finite-dimensional," in the sense that a random walk on those geometries is consistent with the existence and equality of a family of Nash inequalities. In the field of mathematical probabilities known as interacting particle systems (IPS), models such as the voter model, contact process, exclusion process, and Glauber dynamics for the Ising model, all on an infinite d-dimensional lattice, are frequently exemplified, all under the continuing influence of Liggett. A significant motivation for the original development of the field was an as rigorous study of phase transitions in the discipline of statistical physics, which was a significant motivation for the original development of the field. Since the beginning of mathematics, models with similar mathematical structures have been employed as toy models in a variety of domains, most notably in social dynamics, where they have been used to mimic the propagation of attitudes, actions, or information between individuals in a community. For connections between individuals, the closest neighbor lattice model, which is commonly used, is not conceivable in this situation. In situations when there are a limited number of individuals, the finite-time behavior is frequently more relevant than the time-asymptotics behavior. As a result, the context is akin to the study of mixing times for finite Markov chains in a loose sense. The authors' study yields a comprehensive picture of the total variation mixing in a discrete particle dual of the Averaging process, which exhibits, in particular, a cutoff phenomenon in the low-density regime, as a result of their work. They took advantage of the duality of the two processes in order to demonstrate that the dual satisfies a variant of Aldous' spectral gap identity, which was previously unknown. Regardless of the amount of particles in the process, the time required for relaxation is constant.

        <h1>Energy & Environment Forum with Dr. Megan Donahue, Ecologist from Hawaii</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Dr. Megan Donahue (Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology)</li>
            <li>Date: Tuesday, November 16 2021</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Dr. Megan Donahue, co-director of the marine biology program at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, discusses two initiatives that are connected to coral reef management. The first project's goal is to better understand the influence of groundwater on shore reefs. The second study is concerned with coral disease predictions in the tropical Pacific. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) occurs when fresh groundwater seeps onto the reef. The tides have a significant impact on this process. Water is pushed in and out by the pressure exerted by the receding water. She goes on to explain that they are able to determine how much water is drawn from the aquifer based on the amounts of radon that naturally occur in the water. In other words, they are able to differentiate between surface water and ground water based on the radon signal, which is inversely proportional to the ground level. Another characteristic is that groundwater has a low salinity and a high concentration of nutrients. These nutrients are critical for the health of the reefs, and scientists believe that increasing the amount of nutrients available will boost the production of coral reefs. Overall, this study will help to better understand the relationship between groundwater and corals. In order to predict future outbreaks of disease, scientists need to understand the distribution of coral disease in the Pacific. Dr. Donahue explains that the incidence of disease on coral reefs has increased over the past five years. They have discovered that certain coral diseases are present at low levels throughout the Pacific, but then massive outbreaks of disease occur as well as the multitude of factors and parameters that may be at play. They are now trying to figure out what conditions are necessary for these outbreaks to occur. She goes on to say that the spatial and temporal distribution of these outbreaks are difficult to predict, but they are hoping to develop models that are more sophisticated, so they can predict the onset of outbreaks in the Pacific.

        <h1>DNA Topology and Transcription Regulation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Presenter: Dr. Laura Finzi, Emory University, Physics Department</li>
            <li>Date: Wednesday, March 31 2021</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The speaker talks about the topology of DNA as it relates to its transcription and gene. Topology is the study of the anatomical connectivity of a geometric space. The study of topology is useful for understanding the physical limitations of cells; it provides insight into the relationship between gene expression and anatomy; and it can aid in the successful design of human-made materials. The idea behind further research started with a paper on transcription regulation of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci. The paper shows that the transcription is regulated by the topology of the DNA. The speaker talks about the importance of topology here, and how it can be leveraged to better understand transcription.
        The DNA double helix has two basic topologies: right handed or left handed. Although the DNA double helix was discovered in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick, it wasn't until the 1970s that scientists began to identify distinct right-handed and left-handed structures. Right-handed DNA is more abundant and more stable than its left-handed counterpart. Right-handed DNA forms a right-handed (positive) supercoil, and the direction of the rotation is such that each successive turn of the helix winds on in the same direction as the preceding turn. This positive supercoil is formed when the phosphate backbone is pointing toward the right. The direction of the helix is along the axis that contains the sugars. Since the sugar moieties point to the right, so do the backbone carbons and the attached bases. In contrast, left-handed DNA forms a left-handed (negative) supercoil. Here, the direction of the rotation is such that the successive turns of the helix wind on in the same direction as the preceding turn. This negative supercoil is formed when the phosphate backbone points toward the left.

        <p>
           The speaker discusses a variety of topics and examples regarding the on-demand manufacturing of metal components, electronics, as well as recycling and reuse. "NASA is committed to 'faster, better, cheaper,' which includes the use of rapid fabrication processes to enable new and innovative ways to create products and reduce the time it takes to go from idea to launch. This presentation will describe NASA's ability to provide on-demand manufacturing of metal components and rapid prototyping for metals and plastics. It will also cover how NASA is using rapid-prototyping methods to create reusable and recyclable parts, such as food trays and water bottles, as well as reducing waste." The speaker focuses on the importance of recycling and reusing wherever possible, as well as the implications of new manufacturing technologies that are accelerating social and technological change. Fabrication methods such as 3D printing allow for the creation of highly customized and complex structures, and are essential tools for modern manufacturing processes. Important questions to consider are how is the technology changing our infrastructure and industrial design? How can the technology be used to more effectively create optimal and sustainable products, and how can it be used to maximize societal benefit? The speaker focuses on practical implications of innovative technology and how it is changing the way we design products and the way we manufacture them. No longer are we confined to the limitations of traditional manufacturing methods and creation of products, we can create the product we need for the application and the application for the product with on-demand 3D printing.

            their development by having BlueSky automatically generate parts of their projects.

            One of the biggest strengths of BlueSky is it's transparency and discoverability.
            While most of the actions can be done through the graphical user interface, there are many ways to tweak
            statistical models for a fully customizable experience.
            The point-and-click user interface is easy to learn and use; however, the power resides with it's use of
            the powerful R language.
            It allows for easy modification of complex models and algorithms directly to the R code which is readily
            available for the user to look at and tinker with.

        <h1>Data Management Best Practices</h1>
        <ul>

            <li>Presenter: Chris Eaker</li>
            <li>Date: N/A (Asynchronous) 2020</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The speaker talks about a variety of topics and examples regarding the importance of using
            well-designed data management practices and techniques relating to data entry, manipulation, quality
            control, data storage, as well as backups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Properly using data management practices ensures you are able to stay well organized. Data itself must
            not only be well-organized,
            but also must be well documented, preserved, accessible, accurate, and valid.
            The result of using these practices is high-quality data that is easy to share and re-use in science.
            It allows for the citation and credibility of the research, overall cost-saving to furthering science
            research.
            This not only helps you, the researcher, but also the public by allowing the community to build upon the
            work of others, performing meta-analyses, and sharing resources and perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data entry and data manipulation practices to ensure that data is of good quality.
            Allows for better version control and contributions by different teams or team members collaboratively.
            Well-established data-management practices help track data for improved transparency, repoducibility,
            and comparability of results.
            The goals of data entry are to create data that are valid, to ensure quality, organize to support the
            use of the data, as well as the ease of archiving.
            Database vs Spreadsheets pros and cons. Spreadsheets are great for charts, graphs, and calculations.
            They are flexible about cell content type, such that cells in the same column can contain numbers or
            text.
            They lack record integrity, for example you can sort a column independently of all others.
            They are also really to use, but harder to maintain as compelxity and size of data grows.
            Relational databases are easy to query to select portions of data. Data fields are typed;
            for example, only integers are allowed in integer fields. Columns cannot be sorted independently of
            eachother.
            Lastly, they infovlve a steeper leanring curve than a spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality control and assurance practice to reduce errors.
            First, before data collection, a research should think about defining and enforcing standards that will
            be used during a project.
            Consider formats that will be used for the data tables or data entry forms.
            Also, if abbreviations of codes are used, they should be defined up front.
            Measurement units should be also specified, and relevant metadata should be identified before data
            collection.
            Assign rfesponsibility for quality before collection begins.
            Use techniques that help eliminate errors during data entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Design data storage well. Minimize the number of times individual items must be entered repeatedly.
            Use consistent terminology and atomize data: one cell per piece of information.
            Document changes to data, avoid duplicate error checking to save time and allow undos if necessary.
            Always check for missing, impossible, or anomalous values to identify and minimize potential data
            contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Backups deal with data that is copied elsewhere and potentially be overwritten again as the data
            changed.
            They are in essance a snapshot of the data at a point in time.
            This allows the user to restore the file as needed in case of corruption, loss, etc.
            Backups are usually used for short-term storage but sometimes also for long-term storage, usually
            performed on a regular schedule.
            Archiving makes a record of data that is usually in it's final state, and is performed at the end of a
            project or milestones.
            There are many reasons to perform backups, including limiting or negating the loss of data.
            Save time, money, and productivity. Help prepare for disasters, human error, or computer failures.
            Allows to reproduce results, respond to data requests, and overall limits liability.

            This seminar is an interactive discussion and learning opportunity that tackles on a topic called the
            Impostor Syndrome.
            The impostor syndrome is the self-conscious idea that success is highly driven due to luck, rather than
            talend and qualifications.
            The idea was first identified in 1978 by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes.
            Research on the topic has shown that the effect is experienced by both men and women because of an
            inability to internalize on their own successes.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several patterns that have been found in people who experience feelings related to this.
            For example, perfectionist personality types set extremely high expectations for themselves and for
            their work.
            However, a majority have found that even if they meet 99% of their goals successfully, they still feel
            like failures.
            In this case, small mistakes or imperfections in their work will cause a trigger which makes them
            question their own competence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, certain people feel the need to know all extents of information before starting
            a major project and will constantly look for new trainints in order to improve their skills or
            proficiency in a topic.
            In this case, people may exhibit behavior that internalizes their feelings, such as not applying for a
            job if they feel like they don't meet all the criteria.
            Another example which I feel like is very relatable for lots of students is avoiding or being hesitant
            to ask questions regarding their concerns or speaking up in a work or team environment due to the
            feeling of sounding inexperienced or foolish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third, people who tend to excel in a variety of topics, the "natural genius", may feel like an impostor
            when they have to struggle or work unexpectedly hard to accomplish their goal(s). In this specific case,
            it may exhibit the feeling of not being good enough.
            Certain other behaviors that can be seen are people who feel like they need to accomplish a task on
            their own,
            avoiding to ask for help due to feeling that's a sign of weakness or fraud.
            Another case can be with people that constantly push themselves to work harder than everyone else
            for the sole purpose of proving that they're not impostors. They may experience heavy amounts of stress
            when they feel like they're not accomplishing something.
        </p>
        <p>

            The underlying causes of these feelings were also discussed, and the truth is that there may not be a
            single answer to the question.
            Certain experts believe that it may have to do with specific personality traits, such as anxiety or
            neuroticism. However, others focus on more family-related or behavioral causes.
            Perhaps childhood memories, such as achieving a specific set of goals in school or that grades were
            never good enough for parents may be an underlying cause for certain people, for example.
            There are also a multitude of external factors that can influence such behavior, such as the environment
            people live in. For example, levels of confidence can differ widely
            depending on the environment you're surrounding yourself with, such as being around people who look,
            sound, or behave like you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various steps that can help deal with the impostor syndrome, and their effectiveness
            definitely depends upon many specific factors and circumstances.
            For example, try to separate feelings from fact. Just because you may feel stupid, does not mean you
            really are.
            It's also important to normalize and recognize that self-doubt might be a normal response to being a
            beginner, instead of taking self-doubt as a sign of ineptness.
            When inevitable mistakes happen, accentuate the positive outcomes and forgive yourself when the
            inevitable happens.
            Keep in mind and recognize that you have just as much right as the next person to be wrong, have a day
            off, or simply ask for help.
            Visualize your success, develop a new script in your head, as well as a new response to failure and
            mistake-making.
            Lastly, reward yourself as a way to try to break the repeating cycle of seeking and dismissing
            validation for yourself.
        </p>
